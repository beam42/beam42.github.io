<p> My first two attempts at pinhole photography turned out remarkably well: on the left, a 25-minute exposure of my dorm room, taken at night with the lights on-- two stuffed pandas are posed on the desk chair closest to the window. On the right, a 25-minute exposure of the Great Hall at International House, Berkeley, taken a short while later. </p>

<p> Shortly after taking these photos, I read that it's generally a bad idea to take pinhole photos indoors, due to generally dim lighting conditions. This became one of about five reasons I came to expect that my photos would come back completely unusable (other reasons including light leaks, incorrectly loaded film, and a fundamental misunderstanding of some key concept). I was enormously surprised (and just as pleased) when I took my first look at the negatives back from the developer. The only glaring defect is a small light leak, which I was able to identify and eliminate in most future photographs. </p>

<p> Though both images appear darker than 
I would have perhaps liked, they're both obviously photographs-- which is, frankly, much more than I expected from my first attempt at using a homemade pinhole camera!</p>
