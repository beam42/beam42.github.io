    <h1> Quaranteen </h1>

<p> A few days ago, I submitted an article to my local newspaper, where I’m now remote-interning to accommodate social distancing guidelines. The article was meant to address how the college admissions process has changed in the past twenty years; it was directed mostly toward the parents of my fellow 2020 seniors. I thought it would be a good way to put into context just how much more competitive the process has become since our parents went through it a few decades ago. I hoped that with it, I could provide some perspective that families would find valuable, especially as the last of my classmates’ decisions rolled in last week.
</p>

<p>It’s an idea that’d been kicking around in my head for a while, and I was excited to write the article. Unfortunately, I think I botched it. The introduction I ended up writing is strong, but irrelevant-- it does a good job of addressing the impact of the statewide shelter-in-place on my graduating class, but that's not what the article's about. Just as the reader gets invested in that topic, it’s revealed that the true subject of the article is (drumroll please.......) *college admissions!*-- a topic only tangentially related to the introduction. It's an article with two foci, and once the first falls out of focus, the article as a whole never recovers.
</p>

<p>I can try to rationalize my decision to open with the effects of the virus on our senior class: COVID-19 cases are on the rise nationally, with 100,000 to 250,000 Americans expected to die in the coming months. It’s not that I want to hitch a ride on the popular story of the day, it’s just that this is such a solemn issue (literally life and death for millions of families, and a serious threat to millions more livelihoods), that it didn’t feel right to sit and complain about something like it being harder than it used to be to get into UCLA. I decided to check myself by addressing the global pandemic right off the bat. This worked a little too well-- the introduction doesn’t read like an acknowledgement of a larger issue, it reads like an introductory paragraph-- thesis statement and all-- for a topic that I just didn’t write about.
</p>

<p>Yes, the solemnity is conveyed, but I gave the virus issue too much weight-- I ought to have written just a sentence or two, and trusted the audience to weigh my words appropriately. I can write a COVID-19 article (and I will!) later, but this was supposed to be about something else completely.
</p>

<p>I was too self-conscious, too afraid of coming off as uninformed or insensitive. I hedged, and it shows. I can attribute this in part to the pervasive nature of the coronavirus story, but really, this is a problem that I have in general: I hedge my thoughts. I minimize my own issues and ideas out of sympathy for those who I think face greater issues and have grander ideas, but then I go and apply that same philosophy to other issues, to other people’s issues, which pretty much has the opposite of the intended effect. It comes off here as bad writing at best, and a lack of awareness (again, ironic) at worst.
</p>

<p>Basically, this tweet:
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">my emails are increasingly beginning to sound like &quot;sorry to bother you during The Great Entroublement with what is ultimately the most minor of minor problems which i must now, unfortunately and with profuse apologies, make your problem as well, comrade&quot;</p>&mdash; vicky mochama (@vmochama) <a href="https://twitter.com/vmochama/status/1245772611306622978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This is good. I’m fleshing out some of my bad writing and thinking habits with the Press Banner, so that I can stop making those mistakes moving forward. I’ll be writing at least two more articles (hopefully a few more than that) before heading off to college. With luck, my portfolio will see an upward trend. Maybe I’ll even have some decent stuff to show off to the staff of The Daily Californian when I get to Berkeley (assuming first semester isn’t cancelled-- oop, there I go again.)
