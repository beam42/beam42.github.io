    <h1> Quaranteen I</h1>

<p> A few days ago, I submitted an article to my local newspaper, where I’m now remote-interning to accommodate social distancing guidelines. The article was meant to address how the college admissions process has changed in the past twenty years; it was directed mostly toward the parents of my fellow 2020 seniors. I thought it would be a good way to put into context just how much more competitive the process has become since our parents went through it a few decades ago. I hoped that with it, I could provide some perspective that families would find valuable, especially as the last of my classmates’ decisions rolled in last week.
</p>

<p>It’s an idea that’d been kicking around in my head for a while, and I was excited to write the article. Unfortunately, I think I botched it. The introduction I ended up writing is strong, but irrelevant-- it does a fine job of addressing the impact of the statewide shelter-in-place on my graduating class, but that's just not what the rest of the article is about, and even I get whiplash when I look back and read my  own transition to the main point of the article.</p>

<p> Just as the reader gets invested in the topic that's introduced, it’s revealed that the true subject of the article is (drumroll please.......) college admissions, a topic that is maybe tangentially related to the introductory paragraph. In short, it's an article with two foci, and once the first falls out of focus, the article as a whole never recovers.
</p>

<p>I can try to rationalize my decision to open with the effects of the virus on our senior class: COVID-19 cases are on the rise nationally, with 100,000 to 250,000 Americans expected to die in the coming months. It’s not that I want to hitch a ride on the popular story of the day, it’s that this is such a solemn issue (literally life and death for millions of families, and a serious threat to millions more livelihoods), that it didn’t feel right to sit and complain about something like it being harder than it used to be to get into UCLA. I decided to check myself by addressing the global pandemic right off the bat. This didn't work out so well-- the introduction as published doesn’t read like an acknowledgement of a larger issue, it reads like an introductory paragraph-- thesis statement and all-- for a topic that I just didn’t write about.
</p>

<p>Yes, the solemnity is conveyed, but I gave the virus issue too much weight-- I ought to have written just a sentence or two, and trusted the audience to weigh my words appropriately. I can write a COVID-19 article (and I will!) later, but this was supposed to be about something else completely.
</p>

<p>I was too self-conscious, too afraid of coming off as uninformed or insensitive about a larger issue. I hedged, and it shows. I can attribute this in part to the pervasive nature of the coronavirus story, but really, this is a problem I have in general: I hedge my thoughts. I minimize my own issues and ideas out of sympathy for those who I think face greater issues and have grander ideas. In moderation, this is important, but then I go and apply that same philosophy to other people's issues, and out of habit, I minimize them, too. It comes off as bad writing at best, and an ironic lack of awareness at worst.
</p>

<p>Basically, my article reads like this tweet:
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">my emails are increasingly beginning to sound like &quot;sorry to bother you during The Great Entroublement with what is ultimately the most minor of minor problems which i must now, unfortunately and with profuse apologies, make your problem as well, comrade&quot;</p>&mdash; vicky mochama (@vmochama) <a href="https://twitter.com/vmochama/status/1245772611306622978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p> ...verbosity and all. </p>

<p>This is good. I’m fleshing out some of my bad writing and thinking habits with the Press Banner, so that I can stop making those mistakes moving forward. I’ll be writing at least two more articles (hopefully a few more) before heading off to college, so with luck, my next one will be loads better.

<p> Looks like, due to a mistake on the Press Banner's end, I get a chance to fix my mistake before it goes to print. Currently rewriting according to post above.</p>

<p>Well, as of this morning, my article is up and in print. I’ll be the first to say that it’s nothing too special. I still have some unavoidable (and at this point, uncorrectable) stylistic issues with what I wrote, and I wince every time I read a sentence that doesn’t flow well. I wish I’d written “as” instead of “while” in the opening line. I wish I’d kept more of the adverbs that I cut out at the last minute. And for some reason, there’s a missing quotation mark in the print edition that definitely wasn’t missing in my original submission-- that one, at least, I can chalk up to someone else’s error.</p>

<p>All that being said, I’m happy with the article. Writing it was an interesting exercise in journalism sans commentary, which I realize now is new to me. When I wrote for The Youth Journal, my articles often turned into impassioned arguments for or against something; when I wrote letters for my Assemblymember, I was almost always given someone else’s positions to justify; when I wrote my op-eds last year… well, obviously having something of an agenda is just part of the game when you’re writing an op-ed.</p>

<p>As a result, I came into this thinking that I had some experience, when in reality, I didn’t know the first thing about writing an objective journalistic piece. In my effort to compensate for that, I leaned too hard on statistics, I think-- making the article something of a dry, technical read. Maybe that’s okay, since I didn’t have room to flesh out the limitations of the shocking and negative trend that I meant to highlight. If I’d been more explicit, I might have alarmed readers unduly.</p>

<p>I realized a few things as I wrote this article; one was that I’m far more afraid of being either a poor writer or provocative when I personally know or am acquainted with the people who will read what I write. The feeling I have now is remarkably similar to what I felt after my Homecoming performance this year. I feel as if I’ve put myself out there in a risky way, and once again, although there is no negative feedback, the lack of pronounced positive feedback is enough to put a sinking feeling in my stomach.</p>

<p> I also hedged more than usual because I knew that whatever I wrote would almost definitely end up unaltered and in print. When I submitted my articles to the SacBee and LATimes, I assumed that they would probably never see the light of day. If they did, I knew, that would mean they had passed through a rigorous vetting process by people who literally vet articles for a living. It's nice to have that sort of seal of approval on your writing. In a sense, on a state or national level, getting published is more of an achievement than the public kudos that may follow; the opposite is true on a local level.</p>

<p>Next time, I think I’ll take a step back in the commentary direction, only because I’ve overcompensated with my most recent article: an article needs to have a thesis, and it ought to have a narrative. My lesson from the published draft is a sort of extension of my lesson from the unpublished one, detailed above: articles do not exist in isolation, and readers do not live in a vacuum. I need to trust the reader’s ability to infer things, to know things that I don’t tell them, and to recognize the difference between fact and opinion.</p>

<p><em>fun side note: I left my shelter-in-place for the first time in four weeks today, so that I could get a physical copy of The Press Banner with my article in it.</em>
