    <h1> Quaranteen I</h1>

<p> A few days ago, I submitted an article to my local newspaper, where I’m now remote-interning to accommodate social distancing guidelines. The article was meant to address how the college admissions process has changed in the past twenty years; it was directed mostly toward the parents of my fellow 2020 seniors. I thought it would be a good way to put into context just how much more competitive the process has become since our parents went through it a few decades ago. I hoped that with it, I could provide some perspective that families would find valuable, especially as the last of my classmates’ decisions rolled in last week.
</p>

<p>It’s an idea that’d been kicking around in my head for a while, and I was excited to write the article. Unfortunately, I think I botched it. The introduction I ended up writing is strong, but irrelevant-- it does a fine job of addressing the impact of the statewide shelter-in-place on my graduating class, but that's just not what the rest of the article is about, and even I get whiplash when I look back and read my  own transition to the main point of the article.</p>

<p> Just as the reader gets invested in the topic that's introduced, it’s revealed that the true subject of the article is (drumroll please.......) college admissions, a topic that is maybe tangentially related to the introductory paragraph. In short, it's an article with two foci, and once the first falls out of focus, the article as a whole never recovers.
</p>

<p>I can try to rationalize my decision to open with the effects of the virus on our senior class: COVID-19 cases are on the rise nationally, with 100,000 to 250,000 Americans expected to die in the coming months. It’s not that I want to hitch a ride on the popular story of the day, it’s that this is such a solemn issue (literally life and death for millions of families, and a serious threat to millions more livelihoods), that it didn’t feel right to sit and complain about something like it being harder than it used to be to get into UCLA. I decided to check myself by addressing the global pandemic right off the bat. This didn't work out so well-- the introduction as published doesn’t read like an acknowledgement of a larger issue, it reads like an introductory paragraph-- thesis statement and all-- for a topic that I just didn’t write about.
</p>

<p>Yes, the solemnity is conveyed, but I gave the virus issue too much weight-- I ought to have written just a sentence or two, and trusted the audience to weigh my words appropriately. I can write a COVID-19 article (and I will!) later, but this was supposed to be about something else completely.
</p>

<p>I was too self-conscious, too afraid of coming off as uninformed or insensitive about a larger issue. I hedged, and it shows. I can attribute this in part to the pervasive nature of the coronavirus story, but really, this is a problem I have in general: I hedge my thoughts. I minimize my own issues and ideas out of sympathy for those who I think face greater issues and have grander ideas. In moderation, this is important, but then I go and apply that same philosophy to other people's issues, and out of habit, I minimize them, too. It comes off as bad writing at best, and an ironic lack of awareness at worst.
</p>

<p>Basically, my article reads like this tweet:
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">my emails are increasingly beginning to sound like &quot;sorry to bother you during The Great Entroublement with what is ultimately the most minor of minor problems which i must now, unfortunately and with profuse apologies, make your problem as well, comrade&quot;</p>&mdash; vicky mochama (@vmochama) <a href="https://twitter.com/vmochama/status/1245772611306622978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p> ...verbosity and all. </p>

<p>This is good. I’m fleshing out some of my bad writing and thinking habits with the Press Banner, so that I can stop making those mistakes moving forward. I’ll be writing at least two more articles (hopefully a few more) before heading off to college, so with luck, my next one will be loads better.

<h1> Update 4/6/20 </h1>
<p> Looks like, due to a mistake on the Press Banner's end, I get a chance to fix my mistake before it goes to print. Currently rewriting according to post above.
