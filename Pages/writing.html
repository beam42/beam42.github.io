In 2020 I interned for my hometown newspaper, the <i>Press Banner</i>. When a wildfire forced communitywide evacuations, I reached out to nearby daily the <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i>, which agreed to publish my reporting while we were under evacuation orders</i>. 
<ul>
  <li>Wildfire Evacuees Start College Online, Away From Home (Santa Cruz Sentinel)</li>
  <li>Black Lives Matter Protest Reaches Scotts Valley (Press Banner)</li>
    <li>The Ninjas of Scotts Valley (Press Banner)</li>
  <li>Collegebound Athletes Adjust to Pandemic (Press Banner)</li>
</ul>

In 2019 I published op-eds in the Los Angeles Times and Sacramento Bee advocating for a bill that would become California Proposition 18 in 2020:
<ul>
  <li>Vote 'yes' on Prop. 18 to fully enfranchise 18-year-olds (The Daily Californian)</li>
  <li>18 by Election Day? You should get to vote in primary (Los Angeles Times)</li>
  <li>Real discourse happens in primaries. Young voters should have a say (SacBee)</li>
</ul>
