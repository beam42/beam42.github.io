    <h3><center> The Pyramick (2020)</center></h3>
    <center> The pyramick is an original seven-axis puzzle that I first designed and 3D printed at home in mid-2020. It can be looked at as a pyraminx mech mod, or a hybrid between Uwe Meffert's Pyraminx and the "Gimmick" puzzle. Currently something big in the works with this puzzle!

    <h3><center> The Twisted Flame (2020)</center></h3>
    <center> The Twisted Flame is another puzzle that I first designed and 3D printed in mid-2020. It's another pyraminx modification-- in the same spirit as Eitan's twisted cube and twisted skewb, and QiYi's twisted skew, this is not quite a twisted-pyraminx-- more like a twisted windmill pyraminx. See more here.

    <h3><center> The Moldovian Pyramid (2020)</center></h3>
    <center> In 1982, after years of labor, Soviet toymaker Aleksandr Ordynets abandoned an almost-working prototype of his masterwork: the Moldovian Pyramid. In 2020, a bored American teenager used modern technology to design and build this version in two days, without the same fatal flaw.

    <h3><center> Matchblokke (2017-19)</center></h3>
    <center> A puzzle I've revisited several times over the years, the 'Matchblokke' (could also be called a Split 1x3x4 or a Bandaged 2x3x4) is a deceptively complicated puzzle with a surprisingly simple mechanism. The first prototypes were designed piece-by-piece, but the most recent version uses more advanced design methodologies than brute force.

    <h3><center> Helicoptrahedron (2018)</center></h3>
    <center> The helicoptrahedron is another shape transformation of a 12-axis puzzle into a tetrahedral shape, although unlike the reuleauxminx (see below), the twelve axes correspond to the faces of a rhombic dodecahedron, instead of a pentagonal dodecahedron-- introducing totally different pieces, face patterns, and move types.

    <h3><center> The Reuleauxminx (2017)</center></h3>
    <center> Couldn't figure out whether I wanted to make a dodecahedral or tetrahedral puzzle, so this seemed like the obvious choice! It's a  Face-Turning Dodecahedron transformed into a tetrahedron. Reuleauxminxes have been made before, but this is the first 3D printed one that I'm aware of.
