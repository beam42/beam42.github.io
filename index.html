      My name’s Ryan! I'm a high school senior interested in the intersection of science and public policy.

    <p>
      In keeping with a long tradition of teenagers inventing things in California garages, I’ve 3D printed heat shields, <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/blog/eureka-lab/teen-fights-fake-news-one-newsfeed-time">fought the spread of fake news online</a>, and tried to make microgravity drop towers obsolete. Along the way, I’ve picked up awards at state and international science and engineering fairs (<a href="http://csef.usc.edu/">CSEF</a> and <a href="https://www.societyforscience.org/isef/">ISEF</a>, respectively).

      I’m currently lobbying for an amendment to California’s Constitution which would allow 17-year-olds to participate in primary elections if we'll be at least 18 by the corresponding general election. In 2019, I published op-eds making the case for the bill (ACA 4) in <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/article232693267.html">The Sacramento Bee</a> and the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-08-23/california-presidential-primary-17-assembly-constitutional-amendment">Los Angeles Times</a>, and was later featured in a piece on the issue in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/us/california-primary-teens-voting.html">The New York Times</a>.
    
    <p>
      I’m also working on what I call <a href="projects.html">The Jurisdictional Clarity Project</a>, a webtool designed to address the lack of district-specific data on issues like sea level rise and wildfire risk. The goal of the project is to illuminate a blind spot that I first encountered as an intern in the office of my state assemblymember.

    <h1> Why the website? </h1>
  <d>
    I typically use the science fair as an excuse to commit to big projects during the school year— but I intentionally avoided the comp sci category in the past, in part because I expected to be destroyed at the state competition by my more experienced peers from Silicon Valley.
      </d>

   <p>
     My current project, <em>The Jurisdictional Clarity Project</em>, is my first real attempt at computer programming— the idea was just too enticing to pass up. I spent a few months learning enough Python to cobble a prototype together, and now I'm teaching myself HTML/CSS so that I can transform that prototype into a bona fide webtool, and expand from there.

   <p>
     For now, the rest of this site is sort of a web development learning <a href="Pages/jurisclear1.html">sandbox</a>. rybeam.com will serve as an all-in-one platform for any projects or writing that could benefit from an online presence.
