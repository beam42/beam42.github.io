    <p>My name’s Ryan! I’m a high school senior interested in the intersection of science and public policy. I’ve 3D printed heat shields, fought the spread of fake news online, and tried to make microgravity drop towers obsolete, winning awards at state and international science fairs along the way.

    <p> In 2018, I realized that much of my high school graduating class (including myself) would be slightly too young to participate in our state’s primary election-- despite most of us being eligible to vote in the corresponding <em>general</em> election. After a yearlong internship with my state assemblymember, I published op-eds in The Sacramento Bee and the Los Angeles Times, advocating for an amendment to California’s constitution that would allow 17-year-olds to vote in primary elections if they'll be 18 by November. That amendment (ACA 4) is on track to appear on the 2020 ballot for approval by California voters.
