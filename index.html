      Hi, my name’s Ryan! I'm a freshman at UC Berkeley studying mechanical engineering with minors in journalism and public policy.

    <p>
      In keeping with a long tradition of teenagers inventing things in California garages, I’ve 3D printed heat shields, <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/blog/eureka-lab/teen-fights-fake-news-one-newsfeed-time">fought the spread of fake news online</a>, and tried to make microgravity drop towers obsolete. Along the way, I’ve picked up awards at state and international science and engineering fairs (<a href="http://csef.usc.edu/">CSEF</a> and <a href="https://www.societyforscience.org/isef/">ISEF</a>, respectively).

      Right now, I'm lobbying for an amendment to California’s Constitution; Prop 18 (formerly ACA 4) would allow 17-year-olds to participate in primary elections if we'll be at least 18 by the corresponding general election. In 2019, I published op-eds making the case for the bill (ACA 4) in <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/article232693267.html">The Sacramento Bee</a> and the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-08-23/california-presidential-primary-17-assembly-constitutional-amendment">Los Angeles Times</a>, and was later featured in a piece on the issue in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/us/california-primary-teens-voting.html">The New York Times</a>.

      Other projects in various stages of development: a mass-produced mechanical puzzle, a graphic novel, a downhill longboarding club, and a Kennedy march.
