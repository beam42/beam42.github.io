<d>In 2019 I published op-eds in the Los Angeles Times, Sacramento Bee, and Daily Californian, in which I advocated for a bill that would become California Proposition 18 in 2020. </d>

  <p> Ultimately, my advocacy led me to speak to student activist groups across the state; correspond with policymakers from the state legislature to the governor's mansion; and give interviews for outlets ranging from my local TV station to The New York Times. </p>

      <p> Media appearances were by far my least favorite part of the whole experience. As a 17-year-old, I was extremely self-conscious about my age, appearance, and voice. I was unhappy with nearly all of the coverage I received, which I felt twisted my words and misrepresented the issue. I blamed this misrepresentation for the vitriolic comments I found directed toward me, both in-person and in online comment sections.</p>

      <p> However, I had  figured out by then that the best way to get over something that scares you is to get to know it better. The media environment scared me, journalists scared me. If I wanted to stop being afraid, I needed to take a look behind the curtain. I applied to write for my hometown newspaper in early 2020.</p>

      <p>My interview for the local paper, <i>The Press Banner</i>, took place after school on March 13, 2020 I figured then that I would struggle to find newsworthy happenings in my sleepy community. Little did I know that March 13 marked the eve of one of the most eventful 12-month periods in the history of Scotts Valley and the San Lorenzo Valley </p>

<d>In 2020 I covered Black Lives Matter protests, the COVID-19 pandemic, and more for my hometown newspaper, the <i>Press Banner</i>. When a wildfire forced communitywide evacuations, I reached out to nearby daily the <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i>, which published my reporting on the disaster. </d>
