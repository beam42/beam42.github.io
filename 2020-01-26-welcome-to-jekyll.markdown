My name’s Ryan! I’m a senior in high school, and maybe the first thing you should know about me is that I design and 3D print Rubik’s Cube-type “twisty puzzles” in my free time. That feels important.


In keeping with a long tradition of teenagers inventing things in California garages, I’ve also 3D printed heat shields, fought the spread of fake news online, and tried to make microgravity drop towers obsolete. Along the way, I’ve picked up awards at the State and International Science & Engineering Fairs (CSEF and ISEF, respectively).


I’m currently working on what I call The Jurisdictional Clarity Project, a Python-based webtool that addresses the enormous lack of local, district-specific data on issues like sea level rise and wildfire risk-- a gap that I first encountered as an intern in the office of my state assemblymember.


I’m also lobbying for ACA 4, an amendment to California’s Constitution, which would allow 17-year-olds to participate in primary elections if they will be 18-years-old by the corresponding general election. In 2018, I published op-eds making the case for ACA 4 in The Sacramento Bee and the Los Angeles Times, and was later featured for a piece on the issue in The New York Times.

def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
